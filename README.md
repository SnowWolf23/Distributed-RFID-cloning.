# Distributed-RFID-cloning.
It uses an Arduino UNO R4 Minima and a ESP32 board to clone RFID data over a distributed system. 
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) represents an advanced technology that
employs electromagnetic fields for the purpose of wireless object identification
and tracking. This innovative system involves the utilization of tags equipped
with integrated circuits and antennas, enabling seamless communication with
RFID readers to facilitate data transmission and reception. RFID cloning, on the
other hand, denotes the unauthorized replication of RFID tags or cards. This
illegal practice encompasses duplicating the information stored on an authentic
RFID tag and subsequently transferring it to a cloned counterpart. Consequently,
this surreptitious activity may grant unscrupulous individuals unwarranted
access or enable them to assume the identity of the genuine owner. The
inspiration for the project comes from a device called flipper zero, which has
multi-functionality attack capabilities. It uses INDALA protocol to communicate 
with the tags. It has the option to both enter card details manually and also steal
identity via close contact. Then you can save the identities and then can be
emulated to act as tag for illegal display of identity. Addition to duplicating RFID
tags, it also has capabilities of replicating NFC cards and emulating them.
